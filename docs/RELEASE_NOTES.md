CLIProxyBar 0.3.3 fixes a crash in quota reset notifications:

- The app could quit when macOS returned notification settings on a background queue. This affected reset alerts and opening Settings.
- Notification callbacks now handle background replies safely. Settings, reset detection, and alert preferences remain available after the update.

Versions before 0.2.4 need one manual or Homebrew upgrade to get the built-in updater.

CLIProxyAPI records request usage. CLIProxyBar collects these events and saves daily summaries locally while the app runs.
The usage queue retains events for about a minute. Closing the app or sleep can create gaps in recorded history.
Use one collector per proxy because retrieval removes events from the queue.

Requires macOS 14 or later and a CLIProxyAPI instance with management access.
OpenCode Go requires a plugin with native generic quota support.
